## 🎨 Phase 2: Illustrated Cards (Post-Launch)

**After you have revenue from ASCII version:**

1. **Use profits to hire artist** ($500-1000 for 78 cards)
   OR
2. **Generate with Midjourney** ($30)
   OR
3. **Mix:** AI-generate, then hire artist to refine

**Push as update:**
- "Premium users: New illustrated cards available!"
- "Free users: Upgrade now to unlock gorgeous artwork"

**Both tiers coexist:**
- Some users will PREFER ASCII (retro purists)
- Add setting: "Card Style: ASCII / Illustrated"
- Everyone's happy

## ✅ Why This Is The Right Move

### Speed to Market
**Original plan:** 9 weeks
**ASCII plan:** 3 weeks
**Difference:** 6 weeks faster to revenue

### Cost
**Original plan:** $154 (Midjourney + stores)
**ASCII plan:** $25 (Google Play only for MVP)

**ASCII plan:** "THE retro tarot app"

### Your Advantage
