## 1. Brand Voice & Terminology Guide

### What We DON'T Say (Avoid These Traps)
❌ "AI-powered tarot" - Sounds soulless
❌ "Algorithm" - Too technical, breaks mystique
❌ "Machine learning readings" - Cold
❌ "Personalized content" - Corporate speak
❌ Game terminology ("level up", "achievements", "unlock") - Labyrinthos trap
❌ Harsh Co-Star style ("You talk about others because you have no life") - Too mean

### What We DO Say (Our Lexicon)

**Core Concept: Quantum Collapse**
- "Quantum-guided selection" ✨
- "Your intention collapses infinite possibilities"
- "Genuine randomness from the quantum field"
- "Each reading is truly unique - impossible to replicate"

**Personality Assessment (Don't call it a test)**
- "Attunement Questions" (not "personality test")
- "Soul Mapping" or "Energy Profile"
- "Help us understand your unique frequency"
- "Brief reflection to personalize your experience"

**Readings**
- "Spread" (traditional, keep it)
- "Drawing" or "Your Draw"
- "Session" (implies sacredness)
- "Quantum Reading" (our unique term)

**Card Positions**
- Keep traditional names: "Past, Present, Future"
- "What Crosses You" (not "obstacle" - softer)
- "Your Foundation" (not "subconscious" - more accessible)
- "What Crowns You" (beautiful phrasing)

**Subscription Tiers**
- **Free:** "Seeker" - One reading/day, core spreads, ads
- **Premium:** "Mystic" - Unlimited readings, all spreads, no ads, reading history
- **Possible Future:** "Oracle" - Includes premium art decks, deeper analytics
