================================================================================\n","# This cell implements sophisticated transformation strategies that leverage\n","# pattern recognition, object detection, learning, and program synthesis to\n","# solve complex ARC tasks that require multi-step reasoning.\n","#\n","# ARCHITECTURE:\n","# - Pattern-based strategies (using Cell 2 pattern

Applying transformations in the right order (composition)\n","# 4.
